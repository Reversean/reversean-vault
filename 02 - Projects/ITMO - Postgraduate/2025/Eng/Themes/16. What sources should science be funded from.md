Science **has always depended** on stable funding, since research **cannot be carried out** without laboratories, equipment, and skilled professionals. Traditionally, governments **have been providing** the majority of resources, because scientific progress **is considered** to be a public good that benefits the whole society. State funding **is often directed** toward basic research, which may not bring immediate profits but **lays** the foundation for future innovations.

At the same time, private companies **have increasingly been investing** in applied research, especially in fields like artificial intelligence, pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy. **By funding** projects that are likely to generate products or services, businesses **are helping** to speed up technological progress. However, this type of funding **may sometimes be influenced** by commercial interests, which means transparency and ethical standards **must be maintained**.

Another growing source is international cooperation. Large-scale projects, such as those in space exploration or climate modeling, **are often funded** by multinational consortia. High-performance computing centers, for example, **have been supported** jointly by universities, governments, and private industries, because the costs **are too high** for a single actor to cover.

In practice, the most effective funding system **will combine** public investment, private contributions, and international partnerships. **If** these sources **are balanced carefully**, science **will continue to develop** in a sustainable way, benefiting both knowledge itself and society as a whole.
