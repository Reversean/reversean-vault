I would like to discuss about what current scientific communication is based on. Scientific communication is essential for sharing research findings with both the scientific community and the general public.

### 1. Clarity

Firstly, clarity is crucial in scientific communication. Researchers must present their findings in a clear and understandable way. This often means avoiding jargon and using simple language. If scientists are clear in their communication, their work can be more easily understood and appreciated by a wider audience.

### 2. Accuracy

Secondly, accuracy is vital. Scientific communication must be based on reliable data and sound methodology. Researchers should report their results honestly and transparently. Any errors or uncertainties should be clearly stated. This builds trust and ensures that the information being shared is credible. If scientific findings are accurate, they are more likely to be useful and respected.

### 3. Accessibility

Thirdly, accessibility is important. Scientific information should be accessible to everyone, not just experts. This means publishing research in open-access journals, creating summary reports for the public, and using digital platforms to share findings widely. When scientific information is accessible, it allows more people to benefit from the knowledge and apply it in practical ways.

### 4. Engagement

Lastly, engagement plays a key role in current scientific communication. Scientists are increasingly using social media, blogs, and public talks to engage with the public. They answer questions, explain their research, and discuss its implications. This interaction helps to demystify science and makes it more relatable. Engaging with the public fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of scientific work.

### Conclusion

By focusing on these principles, scientists can effectively share their research and ensure that it has a positive impact on society.
