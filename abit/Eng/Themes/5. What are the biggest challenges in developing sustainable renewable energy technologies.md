The shift toward renewable energy **has been recognized as essential** for addressing climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Yet, despite impressive progress, several obstacles **remain unresolved**. The most immediate challenge **is that renewable sources are often intermittent**: the sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow. As a result, efficient energy storage solutions **are urgently required**.

Another difficulty lies in infrastructure. Many national grids **were designed** for centralized fossil-fuel power plants and **are not fully adapted** to the decentralized nature of solar panels or wind farms. Upgrading these systems **is taking time and considerable investment**, which **has slowed** large-scale adoption.

Computation and digital technologies **are playing a vital role** in overcoming these issues. High-performance simulations **have been applied** to optimize turbine efficiency and predict weather-dependent production. At the same time, artificial intelligence **is helping operators to balance** fluctuating energy supplies with demand in real time. Nevertheless, the massive data processing required for these systems **creates additional energy consumption**, which **should not be underestimated**.

Financial and political challenges **must also be addressed**. While the cost of renewable technologies **has fallen dramatically**, subsidies and policy support **are still necessary** in many countries to compete with established fossil fuel industries. Without long-term strategies and global cooperation, even the most advanced solutions **will struggle to reach** their full potential.
