Antibiotic resistance is one of the most urgent threats to public health in the 21st century. **In order to** address this problem effectively, humanity must take a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, governments should regulate the prescription of antibiotics more strictly. **While** it is true that these drugs save millions of lives every year, their overuse in both humans and livestock has accelerated the development of resistant bacteria. **Therefore**, tighter control could significantly slow this dangerous trend.

Another essential measure is public education. Many people still believe that antibiotics can treat viral infections, which is not the case. If awareness campaigns are implemented, individuals will be more likely to follow medical advice and complete prescribed courses properly. This is important because stopping treatment too early allows surviving bacteria to adapt and become stronger.

In addition, scientific research must be encouraged and adequately funded. New antibiotics, as well as alternative treatments such as bacteriophage therapy, could provide fresh solutions. However, these innovations will only succeed **provided that** they are used responsibly and accompanied by effective infection-prevention strategies, including vaccination and improved hygiene standards.

In conclusion, combating antibiotic resistance requires cooperation between policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the public. If we fail to act now, even minor infections could once again become deadly, reversing decades of medical progress.
