My name is Mikhail, and I am currently working as a web developer in the Industrial Stream Data Processing Systems Laboratory at Peter the Great Polytechnic University. In my daily work, I mainly **develop server applications in Java and Kotlin using Spring Boot**, although I **have also gained** practical experience with C#, JavaScript, Python, Haskell, C, C++, and SQL. This variety of programming languages **has allowed me** to become more flexible in solving tasks and to approach problems from multiple perspectives.

At the same time, I am a postgraduate student specializing in _Informatics and Computer Engineering_. My diploma project **was focused on** the fields of program analysis and test design, where I **have been exploring** approaches to generate software tests automatically.

I am deeply interested in metaprogramming, that is, the development of programs which **are able to treat** other programs as data. This area **has always attracted me** because it combines theoretical foundations with practical applications. My long-term plan **is to design tools that will simplify** the development process for other programmers.

This is the main reason why I chose the theme **Automated Software Porting**. The research **is devoted to** studying and implementing methods that allow software to be transferred automatically from one platform to another. The ultimate goal **is to investigate** approaches to software porting via *formal specifications* and to identify opportunities for applying them in real-world scenarios. In particular, I **am planning to analyze** techniques for porting mobile applications from popular platforms such as Android or iOS to less common and still developing systems, for instance, Harmony OS Next.

The scientific relevance of my topic **can be explained by** the growing necessity to adapt mobile software to emerging operating systems. At present, the majority of applications **are specialized** for a single platform, which **creates difficulties** for both users and developers. The availability of automated tools **would make it possible** to adapt applications more easily, even if the supported lists of source and target platforms **remain limited**. Such a solution **could significantly reduce** development costs and, in the long run, **would contribute** to the growth of new platforms and their communities.
