My name is Mikhail, I'am twenty three.

I'm backend-developer in "Industrial straming data processing systems" laboratory belononging to the Polytech of Peter the Great. I mostly develop Java/Kotlin server-applications using Spring Framework. I have also expirience with C#, JavaScript, Python, Haskell, C, C++, SQL programming languages.

I'am graduate student in "Computer science and engineering" from the Polytech of Peter the Great. My graduation work is related to the Program Analysis and Test Design domains.

I'm very interested in field of Program Analysis. It's about automatic discovering of program properties. Analysis process validate functional correctness, security and fault tolerance of software. Also it's used in modern compilers for code optimization.

For me Static Analysis domain is particulary interesting. Comparing to dynamic analysis the static analysis may achive more detail results, especially in defect detection problem.

Unfortunately there is no opportunity for me to develop theoretical and practial skills in this domain during my workintg tasks.

To fix this and develop my sciencific knowledges in this domain, I decided to continue my graduation. I choose ITMO becase here i was able to find supervisor who has extensive expirience in this field.

My chosen dissertation theme is about techniques "symbolic execution" and "property-based testing".

Symbolic execution is static analysis techinque that allows to determine what inputs cause each program part to execute. It's used in various program analysis tools.

Property-based testing was originally developed for random testing of Haskell program properties by using some predicates and auto-generated input data. Now this approach is also gaining popularity on another platforms.

Both symbolic execution and property-based testing are actively used to ensure software quality. It's possible that using both of them together could improve efficiency of software verification. I would like to research how to combine these techniques in close years.
