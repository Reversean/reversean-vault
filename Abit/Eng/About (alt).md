My name is Mikhail, and I'm twenty-three years old.

I'm backend developer in the "Industrial Streaming Data Processing Systems" laboratory belonging to the Polytech of Peter the Great. I mostly develop Java/Kotlin server applications using the Spring Framework. I also have experience with C#, JavaScript, Python, Haskell, C, C++, and SQL programming languages.

I am a graduate student in "Computer Science and Engineering" from the Polytech of Peter the Great. My graduation work is related to the Program Analysis and Test Design domains.

I am very interested in the field of Program Analysis. It's about the automatic discovery of program properties. Analysis process validates the functional correctness, security, and fault tolerance of software. It is also used in modern compilers for code optimization.

For me, the Static Analysis domain is particularly interesting. Compared to dynamic analysis, static analysis can achieve more detailed results, especially in defect detection.

Unfortunately, there is no opportunity for me to develop theoretical and practical skills in this domain during my working tasks.

To fix this and develop my scientific knowledge in this domain, I decided to continue my education. I chose ITMO because here I was able to find a supervisor who has extensive experience in this field.

My chosen dissertation theme is about techniques "symbolic execution" and "property-based testing."

Symbolic execution is a static analysis technique that allows determining what inputs cause each part of a program to execute. It is used in various program analysis tools.

Property-based testing was originally developed for random testing of Haskell program properties by using some predicates and auto-generated input data. Now this approach is also gaining popularity on other platforms.

Both symbolic execution and property-based testing are actively used to ensure software quality. It is possible that using both of them together could improve efficiency of software verification. I would like to research how to combine these techniques in the coming years.
