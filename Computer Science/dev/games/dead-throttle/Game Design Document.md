# Dead Throttle

*by Reversean*

## Game Summary

**Dead Throttle** is a 2D-metroidvania in a post-war, desolate city of near future where players explore and fight while riding a **motorcycle**. As they traverse both residential and industrial zones, players unlock new abilities tied to the physics of the bike, allowing for deeper exploration and combat tactics. The game combines **dynamic motorcycle-based combat**, fast-paced platforming, and extensive **bike customization** to create a unique blend of exploration, action, and player-driven progression.

### Game Design Pillars

#### 1. City of Dead Megastructures

**Traverse a war-torn city filled with industrial megastructures and desolate residential zones.** 

The game focuses heavily on exploration, where players navigate an open-world city that blends residential districts (houses, offices, shopping centers) with massive industrial areas. The atmosphere evokes a sense of melancholy and insignificance as players move through vast, abandoned spaces. Exploration is primarily done **on the motorcycle**, with platforming across horizontal and vertical planes. Movement is tightly integrated with the bike’s physics, where players use various devices to traverse obstacles and discover hidden areas.

#### 2. Combat Motorcycle 

**Engage in dynamic battles while riding your bike.**  

Throughout exploration, players will face enemies of varying size, movement patterns, and attack styles. Combat is fast-paced and takes place on spacious arena-like zones, where the motorcycle becomes both a weapon and a tool for maneuvering. The bike's **physical properties** (speed, momentum, positioning) influence how attacks and abilities work, while firearms serve as secondary tools. These arenas provide enough room for strategic positioning, platforming, and executing special abilities, making each encounter unique and tactical.

#### 3. Build your Own Battle Machine

**Enhance your motorcycle with unique, handcrafted modifications.**  

The game world features a complex infrastructure that allows players to upgrade and modify their bike using advanced technology found throughout the city. These upgrades improve mobility, unlock new combat abilities, or offer hybrid benefits that balance both. The customization system offers a wide range of playstyles, allowing players to tailor their bike’s performance to suit different approaches, from agile maneuverability to heavily armored combat strategies.

### User Expiriences

The Game is a metroidvania where exploration and combat revolve around the use of a **motorcycle**. The bike plays a central role, with **physics-based mechanics** that influence movement and combat. Abilities and devices adapt based on the bike's properties, creating dynamic and fast-paced gameplay.

## Core Gameplay

### Aim of the Game

In **Dead Throttle** players will engage in a mix of exploration, fast-paced platforming, intense combat, and strategic customization, all tied to the physics of the motorcycle. Navigate through abandoned residential districts and towering industrial megastructures, uncovering hidden lore, resources, and new technologies to power up your bike and push further into the world.

**The core objective of the game** is to explore this desolate world, unlock its secrets, and enhance your motorcycle’s capabilities. Players will collect upgrades, discover forgotten stories, and battle through challenging enemies in dynamic, combat-driven arenas. Along the way, players must solve puzzles, utilize the environment to their advantage, and develop creative strategies to overcome increasingly powerful foes.

What sets this game apart is the **unique integration of motorcycle-based combat and exploration**, where the bike isn’t just a vehicle, but a weapon and tool. Players will have the freedom to customize their motorcycle to suit their playstyle, altering how abilities and attacks function, allowing for endless combinations and tactical depth.

Emotionally, the game offers a **vibrant yet dark experience**. Combat is exhilarating and fun, with a colorful, high-energy aesthetic, but beneath the surface lies a world filled with melancholy and isolation. Players will feel the excitement of fast, visceral battles, while exploring a hauntingly quiet city filled with echoes of the past. It will require sharp thinking and fast reflexes to navigate the ruins, solve environmental puzzles, and outmaneuver enemies using the bike’s physics and abilities.

The game is aimed at fans of **metroidvanias and 2D action-platformers**, particularly those who enjoy games like *Hollow Knight*, *Nine Sols* or *Laika: Aged Through Blood*. It offers a rewarding challenge for players who love exploration, combat variety, and deep customization.
